## Project Description

Uni Assist is a user-friendly solution to university assessment help. Provides AI chat assistant as well as a public discussion board forum and uses server-side authenticated login and registrations.

## Architecture

The web application follows a client-server architecture, through API requests and HTTP.
Note that normal web application behaviour may be affected by ad-blocking browser extensions.

## Getting Started

To launch the web application, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)


```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the application:

```shell
python3 app.py
```

5. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5001/`.

## Unit Tests

The web application includes unit tests to ensure its functionality and reliability. To run the unit tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies (if not already done):

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the unit tests:

```shell
python3 tests.py
```

The test suite will execute and display the results in the console.
